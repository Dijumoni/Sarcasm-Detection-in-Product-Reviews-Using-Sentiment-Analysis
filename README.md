# Sarcasm-Detection-in-Product-Reviews-Using-Sentiment-Analysis
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect instances of sarcasm in product reviews and improve sentiment analysis accuracy. The model will be trained on a dataset of product reviews that have been annotated as either sarcastic or non-sarcastic.
